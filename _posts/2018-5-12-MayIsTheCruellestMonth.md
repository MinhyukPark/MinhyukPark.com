title: May Is the Cruellest Month
---

May is the cruellest month. Being a guest at a place you used to call home is a reminder of how things change. How we all change. It's an old story that didn't happen that long ago. Everyone else has moved on already. New house, new chopsticks, new chair, new bed, new pillow, new church. Everything so lively and exciting. Yes let's get rid of everything that's old while we're at it. Dog? gone. Stuffed animals? gone. Chair and desk? gone. Wait, when did all of this happen? Where was my cue to exit? So here I am, standing at the intersection of old and new. I would love to write a book about the story of my life but some stories are not meant to be told. Though if I were to tell my story one day, it would probably start with 'it's an old story that didn't happen that long ago'.

Besides pondering about my place in the world, there are other more useful things I plan on doing this summer, but I would rather not concern myself by rambling about practical and actually useful things.

I'm still not sure in which direction I want to take this blog but surely something will come along as long as interesting things continue to  happen in my life. Right?
