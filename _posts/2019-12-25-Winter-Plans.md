title: Yes or Yes

Well I can't believe it's already winter. I really should be writing more in general. It probably would have helped a lot for grad school applications. It feels weird that I'll be heading to graduate school soon. Correction. I'll be heading to graduate school soon if I get in. I hope I do. There's a lot of things I want to do if I get in. Instead of regurgitating the academic goals, I'll try to list some goals of my life I'm setting for myself this break.

The first goal was figuring out docker and kubernetes and seeing where they fit into my workflow. I'm glad to say that I've definitely found good places where they naturally integrate into and happy that they will soon replace most if not all of my virtual environments and virtual machines.

Ok yes I'll admit that the literal first goal I have here is probably not something I should be describing as part of my life goals. So the second goal, and the first actual goal I'm proud to say, is to workout with a well-defined structure. I have practically rid of any potential excuses I might have for myself so I'll be more than marginally disappointed in myself if I can't keep up with my workout goals.

One thing I learned is that setting too many goals can often times be worse than not setting any goals at all, hence it need not be further explained why there's only one goal on my list. There are a lot of other secondary things I wish to do this break such as picking up a new book, doing preparatory work for next semeseter's research, improving and optimizing dotfiles, having a solid backup tool for all partitions, gathering snacks to bring back to college, migrating my audio workstation setup to linux, and many more.

Fair enough. In case my future self is wondering why in the world the title of this post is Yes or Yes, it's because I'm trying to give myself only one option for following through with my goals.
