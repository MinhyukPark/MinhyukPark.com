title: Good Things Happen
---

Good things happen if you keep on moving. When I was in middle school, that sentence would ring my ears on the wrestling mat. Every time I was too exhausted or too tired with dull eyes looking to give up, the assistant coach would tell me again and again that good things happen if you keep on moving.

It's not a very deep or thought-provoking statement as it stands. It simply and quite literally means that good things happen if you keep on moving. Nevertheless it stuck with me longer than I expected. It stuck with me longer than some of my best friends whose friendship I thought would last a lifetime. There's an unexplainable quality about this short sentence that I simply never could erase it out of my mind.

I also can't deny that as I have gotten older I have started to romanticize certain things in the past and this is most definitely a case of that. It's not that I whole-heartedly concur with the statement and hence I have held it close to my heart. I may or may not have at some point in the distant past, but my point is that whether I do or did is irrelevant to the importance I attribute to this statement. This statement has transfigured itself into something meaningful to me by becoming the summary of my middle school and early high school years. It's nothing more than a convenient way for me to remember those times in the same vein that certain songs from middle school bring back those middle school memories.

The irony is that even though I claim all these things, I still sincerely believe the statement to be true and somewhat profound. Good things do happen if you keep on moving. I find it to be true now with homework, with projects, with internship searches, and I presume so with graduate school as well.

I want to be in a place of my choosing. Somewhere that was once a destination. I would prefer not to be standing still and have the world revolve around me.
