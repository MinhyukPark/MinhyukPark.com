It seems that flowers take a long time to bloom as is the case with most beautiful things in life. Flowers also require delicate care. Everything from getting the right amount of sunlight to the right amount of rain, enduring the cold harsh winters and scorching hot summers, and finally after all that life throws its way, a flower blooms. Someone once told me that the reason flowers are the gift of choice for graduation, marriage, and other important life events is that gifting flowers is an acknowledgement of all the happy moments and sad nights, the bitterness of life and unbearable hardships, and all the moments one had to go through, and a celebration how wonderfully and beautifully another flower bloomed. I simply wish I could tell all of the people I know who are nurturing their own flowers that their flowers are going to be the most beautiful flowers the world has ever seen.
