May is the cruellest month. Being a guest at a place you used to call home is a reminder of how things change. How we all change. It's an old story that didn't happen that long ago. Everyone else hase moved on already. New house, new chopsticks, new chair, new bed, new pillow, new church. Everything so lively and exciting. Yes let's get rid of everything that's old while we're at it. Dog? gone. Stuffed animals? gone. Chair and desk? gone. Wait, when did all of this happen? Where was my cue to exit? So here I am, standing at the intersection of old and new, trying to fit into a place I no longer belong in.I would love to write a book about the story of my life but some stories are not meant to be told, Though if I were to tell my story one day, what better way to start than 'it's an old story that didn't happen that long ago'.

Besides pondering about my place in the world, I also have to figure out my schedule for next semester. I'm still not sure which direction to head in Computer Science and figuring that piece out would be really helpful. Ideally I would like to do a year-long senior thesis but we'll see if I can fit that into my schedule. In terms of reading, once I finish reading Dante's Divine Comedy, I'll pick up another book and hopefully finish before the school starts back up again. I'll try to workout somewhat regularly but I don't plan on going to a gym on a regular basis.

I'm still not sure which direction I want to take this blog but surely something will come along as long as interesting things continue to  happen in my life. For the foreseeable future it will be mostly my reflection on Dante's Divine Comedy as I read through the pages.
