title: Graduate School
---

I got into grad school! In a weird sense I feel like this validates my college years as having been well spent. It really feels like the culmination of what I did in college, and satisfactorily so. I feel like I am one step (one huge step) closer to achieving my dreams as vague as they are in the present moment. It will probably revolve around extended academic life and a little bit of corporate environments but ultimately leading to something I can't even envision right now.

I know that I'll be ok as long as I take things slow and tackle one thing at a time but I can't help but get tedious sometimes. I wish I could stop looking forward too much. Even if I don't things usually work out rather fine for me. A fun thing I've been trying recently is trying to something new or unique everyday even if it's silly or small.

Something surprising today was my apartment offering a $500 visa gift card for renewing my lease. This blog post is really not that intellectually engaging. That's alright. I'll have to finish writing my undergraduate thesis soon, and I felt like I needed some writing practice anyway. At least whoever administers the GRE thinks I am excellent at writing so there's that.

Another odd thing I've recently been trying is literally staying up all night because I can't get up early for the life of me. Something definitely changed since I used to be able to wake up whenever I wanted. Going to starbucks first thing in the morning is, however, one of my absolute favorite things. It gives me so much joy it makes my entire day happier.

I'll be back soon with an update on how a bestfriend of mine ended up in a deep deep maze.
